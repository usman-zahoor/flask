# flask

This repository demonstrates the fundamental concepts of building web applications using Flask. It covers key functionalities such as rendering HTML templates, navigating between pages with url_for, and handling form submissions using both GET and POST methods.This repository provides a basic understanding of Flask's core functionalities, laying the foundation for building more complex web applications.

**Rendering Templates:** Dynamically integrating Python with HTML to generate web pages based on server-side data and logic.  

**URL Routing with url_for:** Simplifying navigation by generating dynamic URLs for different endpoints, ensuring consistency even when the URL structure changes.  

**Handling GET and POST Requests:** Managing form data submissions with GET (retrieving data) and POST (submitting data) methods, enabling interaction between the user and the server.
